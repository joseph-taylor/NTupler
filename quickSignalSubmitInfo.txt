Because there are 60+ different signal mass points. This makes all the data processing stages described in workflowOutline.txt rather laborious.
Fortunately, for each stage we have a work around.
Unfortunately, the work around is a bit nasty.

ALL THESE WORKAROUNDS USE INFO IN: batchJobs/SignalMonteCarloDict.py
(they loop through the relevant dictionaries)

These explanations have the same numerical index as in workflowOutline.txt

1: miniAOD ---> ntuples
=======================
code: plugins/quickSignalSubmit_crab.py
execution (do from plugins directory): $ python quickSignalSubmit_crab.py <yearOfRun>

Have everything setup as normal...BUT...
a. include NAMEXYZ in the uniqueName. E.g. uniqueName = 'NAMEXYZ_CMSSW8029wDBTV4_9b0ff8'
b. use DATASETXYZ for the dataset name. E.g. config.Data.inputDataset = 'DATASETXYZ'
^For example see: TODO_INSERT

MAKING FILELISTS:
code: batchJobs/quickSignalSubmit_filelists.py

2: ntuples ---> flatTrees
=========================
CODE: main/quickSignalSubmit_flatTrees.py
TODO - EXPLANATION



3b: flatTrees ---> histos
=========================
CODE: quickSignalSubmit_histos.py
CODE: quickSignalSubmit_histos_SQUARKONLY.py
